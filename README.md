# Neuron Model Simulator

An interactive tool for developing fundamental understanding of how neuron cells function, and the Biological mechanisms involved in this function. You also learn how Physics concepts can be utilized alongside biological details to mathematically model the dynamics of these cells. You get to explore computational models with varying biological details that simulate neuron dynamics and also explore how environmental factors such as temperature affect various aspects pertaining to neural dynamics.

## Overview

Neurons are excitable cells that generate electrical signals (action potentials or spikes) to communicate with each other. This Streamlit application provides hands-on exploration of:

- **Neuron anatomy** and the function of different cellular components
- **Electrical properties** of neurons and their biophysical basis
- **Computational models** used to simulate neural dynamics
- **Temperature effects** on neural activity and spike properties

This is an educational tool for learning purposes, inspired from classical research on neuroscience and neural dynamics, particularly the pioneering work of Hodgkin and Huxley on action potential modeling. This application also allows for exploration for more generalized models inspired from the Hodgkin-Huxley model, applicable to songbird research, carried out in the research group of Prof Dezhe Jin at the Pennsylvania State University.
